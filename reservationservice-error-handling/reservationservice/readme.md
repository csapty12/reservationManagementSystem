# Reservation Service Error Handling
## Project Setup

In any application you develop, you should always think about 
the possibilities of something going wrong. By doing this,
you can create more resilient systems that can handle failure
gracefully rather than bringing your service down entirely. 
Remember, we cannot trust that the consumers of the API we 
create are going to utilise it correctly. 

As a result, within our service, we should validate 
incoming requests, and gracefully handle invalid data 
through out our service for the best user experience.

The purpose of this project is to implement validation and 
error handling into the Reservation management Service. 

The branches for Part-1 of this 2 part project focuses on 
bean validation only.
The branches for Part-2 of this 2 part project focuses on 
error handling within the service, assuming that part 1 has
already been completed.
